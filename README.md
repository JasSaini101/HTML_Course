All of the CSS and HTML files are for an online course I took over winter break.
The course is on youtube under the channel SuperSimpleDev.
Great course, truly feel like I understand HTML and CSS at a higher level
and with my coding background, it won't be hard to pick up what wasn't mentioned
in the course.
